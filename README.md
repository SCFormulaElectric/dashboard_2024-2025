# Dash Board

Dashboard implementation for USC's F1 Electric Car. We use a Teensy4.1 microcontroller to send data to the Nextion LED screen to display essential data to the driver such as battery charge and speed. The Teensy recieves these important data by reading data from the VCU.

To get started, flash the dashboard.ino software onto the teensy4.1 via USB connection. Connect UART serial lines to dashboard. Connect CAN bus to VCU.
